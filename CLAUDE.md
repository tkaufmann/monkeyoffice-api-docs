# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the MonKey Office Connect JSON-API Reference documentation (version 22.1.1). The project consists of a single HTML file containing comprehensive API documentation.

## Files and Structure

- `moapi.html` - Large HTML documentation file (643KB) containing the complete API reference with styling, navigation, and detailed API specifications

## Working with the Documentation

- The HTML file is quite large and should be read in sections using offset/limit parameters
- Contains German language API documentation ("MonKey Office Connect JSON-API Referenz")
- Includes embedded CSS styling and navigation elements
- No build process, testing framework, or package management - this is a standalone documentation file

## Development Notes

- This appears to be generated documentation rather than source code
- No package.json, build scripts, or development dependencies present
- The repository contains only the final documentation output
